This project is a simple calculator web app that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has a modern and minimal design with two themes: Dark and Light. It shows the equation and the result on the same screen, making it easy to check your calculations. It can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It also has a clear button that resets the input and output fields.
